# Lumibin  
Illuminating Urban Waste Management with AI-Powered Geo-Tracking and Gamification.


----



## üåü Overview  
Lumibin is a cutting-edge solution for tackling urban waste problems. Using **advanced AI technologies**, **real-time geo-tagging**, and community **gamification mechanics**, Lumibin transforms waste management into an efficient, scalable, and collaborative process.  

This system detects litter automatically, pinpoints its location using GPS, and alerts municipal authorities for immediate action. To foster community engagement, it also incorporates a leaderboard system to reward users for identifying waste hotspots.
